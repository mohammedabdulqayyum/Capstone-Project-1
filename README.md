Customer and Product Sales Analysis in Azure Databricks with Data Governance and Security.

This project implements an end-to-end data engineering solution using Azure Databricks to analyze sales transactions and ensure data governance, security, and compliance. The data is ingested into a Lakehouse following Medallion Architecture. Additional elements include data validation, error handling, logging, and SCD Type 1 implementation for the product table. Data governance policies, including access control and data masking, are applied. The workflow is automated, with scheduling based on new data arrivals to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). Business insights are visualized using a dashboard.
